                    <p>Our project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to understand the impact and trends globally and by continent. The following steps outline how we derived key insights from the data using SQL.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>To analyze COVID-19 data by exploring infection rates, death counts, vaccination progress, and creating visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The analysis aims to provide insights into infection rates, death counts, and vaccination coverage across different regions. The goal is to identify trends, high-impact areas, and vaccination progress globally and by continent.</p>
